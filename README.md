Work in Progress

A file named local-config.yaml must be present in the ./config folder. It takes the format of the file local-config.default.yaml. Only the deviceId is required. 

For ffmpeg to work the environment variable FFMPEG_PATH must point directly to executable or the ffmpegOverridePath property in local-config.yaml must be set to the executable path.
